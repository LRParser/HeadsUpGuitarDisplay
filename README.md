# Project Overview #

We present a head-mounted system designed for the Microsoft HoloLens that allows a guitarist/singer to reference chord and lyric information that appears to “float in space” and follow the gaze of the performer. In this way he/she can still engage with an audience while having detailed musical notation information easily accessible. A video of the system in action is accessible at https://youtu.be/10NSf5YZFRg

# Build Instructions #

The solution can be compiled and deployed to a HoloLens device via opening FPS.sln in Visual Studio 2017.1 per instructions at: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/using_visual_studio

Note that FPS was an early name for the project, eg First Person Simulator. The HoloToolkit and specifically https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/blob/master/Assets/HoloToolkit/Utilities/Scripts/SimpleTagalong.cs
were used during design of this project, however all major code elements were written by myself.
